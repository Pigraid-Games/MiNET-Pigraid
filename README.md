# 🐷 **PigNet (Pigraid Edition)**

**Current Supported Minecraft Version:** 1.21.70

## 📖 **What is PigNet?**

**PigNet** is a fork of [MiNET](https://github.com/NiclasOlofsson/MiNET), customized and maintained primarily for the Pigraid Studio and its Minecraft network, Pigraid Network.

🙏 **Special thanks** to all the amazing contributors of MiNET and especially to [Laz1444](https://github.com/laz1444), whose work significantly influenced this project!

## 🚀 **What's New?**

PigNet introduces a variety of enhancements, including:

- ✅ **Full Support for Latest Minecraft Bedrock Edition**
- 🌎 **1.13 World Format Compatibility**
- ⚙️ **Basic Redstone Functionalities**
- 📦 **Completely Rebuilt Resources and Formats** *(making future updates smoother!)*
- 🕺 **Emotes Support**
- 🎒 **New and Improved Inventory System**
- 📡 **Packet Cleanup & Complete Implementation** *(Aligned with [Mojang Bedrock Protocol Naming](https://mojang.github.io/bedrock-protocol-docs/html/packets.html))*

**Note:** No more `MCPE Protocol.cs`. Each packet is neatly organized into individual files following Mojang's packet naming conventions.

## 🎨 **Resource Packs**

Resource packs made for the latest game version should work seamlessly with PigNet. Simply rename packs with `.mcpack` extensions to `.zip`, and you're ready to go!

## ⚠️ **Stability and Development**

While PigNet sees active use within Pigraid Network, it might not contain every possible feature, fix, or update required for all production environments. Continuous improvements and refinements are ongoing!

If you discover issues or have solutions, please don't hesitate to submit an issue or a pull request.
