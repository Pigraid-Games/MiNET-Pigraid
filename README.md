MiNET (Pigraid edition)
=====

Current Supported Minecraft Version: 1.21.70

## What is this?

This is fork of [MiNET](https://github.com/NiclasOlofsson/MiNET), that includes additional changes and features:

 - Latest Minecraft Bedrock Edition support
 - 1.13 world format support
 - Basic redstone functions
 - Rebuilt resources and formats for easier updating
 - Emotes
 - New Inventory System
 - No more MCPE Protocol.cs. Each packet has it's own file, and also, we are using the naming convention of [Mojang Bedrock Protocol](https://mojang.github.io/bedrock-protocol-docs/html/packets.html)
 - And more

**ResourcePacks** - Resource packs made for the latest game version should work also here. If you got pack with .mcpack extension, just rename it to .zip and it's good to go.
